COP 2801 assignment random generated power values
/*Vessela Lytle/547557/COP2801
Write a program called average_power.js. We will simulate taking current and voltage 
readings from a circuit and calculating the average power of the circuit. 
The program should create an array called volts and populate it with 24 random 
numbers between 5 and 20. Next create an array called amps and populate it with 
24 random numbers between 1 and 10. These are your current readings for every hour 
for a given day. */
